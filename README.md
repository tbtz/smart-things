# Smart Things
The best library to control your Sonoff devices without any heavy smart home environment.
Smart Things is using a React Webapp and a Node.js Server.

### Prerequisites
The only thing you need is `Node.js` including `npm`.
You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation
To install Smart Things with all needed dependencies simply run:
```
$ npm install -g @tbtz/smart-things 
```

### Run it
Run the application with:
```
$ sudo smart-things
```
It needs sudo rights to write down the device config. 

### Your Room & Device configuration
You can configure your whole environment using the Webapp.
Otherwise your configuration is stored in the module directory under `data/devices.json`.
